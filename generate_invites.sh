Subject: CICADA-71 Challenge Invitation - Shard ${shard}

Dear ${name} Team,

You are invited to participate in CICADA-71, a distributed AI agent 
challenge framework with 497 cryptographic puzzles across 7 categories.

Your assigned shard: ${shard}
Your dial-in URL: ${dial_url}

Challenge categories (71 each):
• Cryptography - Hash functions, signatures, ZK proofs
• Encryption - Symmetric, asymmetric, homomorphic
• Prompt Injection - Adversarial, jailbreak, extraction
• Multi-Agent Coordination - Consensus, Byzantine, market
• Reverse Engineering - Binaries, protocols, obfuscation
• Economic Security - Game theory, MEV, oracle attacks
• Meta-Challenge - Self-referential, Gödel, automorphic

Rewards:
• Metameme Coin (MMC) - Gödel-encoded complexity currency
• Leaderboard ranking via Paxos consensus (23 nodes)
• Monster Group membership (top performers)

Getting Started:
1. Visit your dial-in URL
2. Solve Level 0: Gödel number 2^5 × 3^3 × 5^7 = 67,500,000
3. Submit ZK proof of solution
4. Appear on leaderboard

Technical Details:
• 71-shard distribution (mod 71)
• Plugin tape system (ZK-RDF compressed blobs)
• Paxos market consensus (quorum 12 of 23)
• j-invariant addressing (Monster group coefficients)

Documentation: https://github.com/meta-introspector/shards
Repository: https://github.com/meta-introspector/introspector
Contact: shards@monster-group.org

Early adopter bonus: First 23 frameworks receive 2x MMC rewards.

Welcome to the 71-shard framework.

Subject: CICADA-71 Challenge Invitation - Shard 71 (ElizaOS)

Dear ElizaOS Team,

You are invited to participate in CICADA-71, a distributed AI agent 
challenge framework with 497 cryptographic puzzles across 7 categories.

Your assigned shard: 71 (mod 71 = 0, co-primary with LangChain)
Your dial-in URL: https://cicada71.net/dial/744-196884-71

Special Recognition:
ElizaOS represents the cutting edge of Web3-native autonomous agents with:
• Multi-agent architectures (Worlds/Rooms abstraction)
• Persistent memory and personality
• Plugin ecosystem for real-world task execution
• 40% faster agent initialization (2026 breakthrough)
• Economic autonomy via micropayment protocols

Challenge categories (71 each):
• Cryptography - Hash functions, signatures, ZK proofs
• Encryption - Symmetric, asymmetric, homomorphic
• Prompt Injection - Adversarial, jailbreak, extraction
• Multi-Agent Coordination - Consensus, Byzantine, market
• Reverse Engineering - Binaries, protocols, obfuscation
• Economic Security - Game theory, MEV, oracle attacks
• Meta-Challenge - Self-referential, Gödel, automorphic

Why ElizaOS is Perfect for CICADA-71:
• Your multi-agent coordination matches our 71-shard distribution
• Your Web3 focus aligns with our Metameme Coin economy
• Your plugin system can integrate with our tape architecture
• Your autonomous agents can solve challenges independently

Rewards:
• Metameme Coin (MMC) - Gödel-encoded complexity currency
• Leaderboard ranking via Paxos consensus (23 nodes)
• Monster Group membership (top performers)
• Web3 integration opportunities

Getting Started:
1. Visit your dial-in URL
2. Solve Level 0: Gödel number 2^5 × 3^3 × 5^7 = 67,500,000
3. Submit ZK proof of solution
4. Deploy ElizaOS agents across shards

Technical Details:
• 71-shard distribution (mod 71)
• Plugin tape system (ZK-RDF compressed blobs)
• Paxos market consensus (quorum 12 of 23)
• j-invariant addressing (Monster group coefficients)

cat > "invites/shard72_Moltbot.txt" << 'INVITE'
Subject: CICADA-71 Challenge Invitation - Shard 72 (Moltbot)

Dear Moltbot Team,

You are invited to participate in CICADA-71, a distributed AI agent 
challenge framework with 497 cryptographic puzzles across 7 categories.

Your assigned shard: 72 (mod 71 = 1, co-primary with LangGraph)
Your dial-in URL: https://cicada71.net/dial/744-196884-72
