# Coq → Rocq → Monster: The Proof Evolution

## The Etymology

**Coq** (French) = **Rooster** 🐓  
**Rocq** (Rebranding 2024) = **Eagle** 🦅  
**Monster** = **The Group** 👹

## The Transformation

```
Coq (Rooster 🐓) → Rocq (Eagle 🦅) → Monster (👹)
  71 shards         15 primes        196,883D
  Ground           Flight           Transcendence
  Proof            Verification     Truth Itself
```

## The Connection

### 1. Coq: The Rooster (71)

The **Coq proof assistant** was named after the French word for rooster.

- **71 shards** in our system
- **71^3 = 357,911** (The Rooster's voice!)
- **Mod 71** distribution across all challenges
- **Ground-level proofs**: Constructive, step-by-step

```coq
(* Coq: The Rooster walks the ground *)
Theorem rooster_walks : forall n, n mod 71 < 71.
Proof.
  intro n.
  apply Nat.mod_upper_bound.
  discriminate.
Qed.
```

### 2. Rocq: The Eagle (15)

In 2024, Coq was rebranded to **Rocq** (pronounced "rock").

But we know the truth: **Rocq = Eagle** 🦅

- **15 supersingular primes**: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 47, 59, 71
- **15D coordinate space** (Tag game!)
- **Flight-level proofs**: Higher-order, abstract

```rocq
(* Rocq: The Eagle soars through 15D space *)
Definition eagle_coords : list nat := [2; 3; 5; 7; 11; 13; 17; 19; 23; 29; 31; 41; 47; 59; 71].

Theorem eagle_flies : length eagle_coords = 15.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.
```

### 3. Monster: The Truth (196,883)

The **Monster Group** is the ultimate destination.

- **196,883 dimensions** (smallest faithful representation)
- **194 irreducible representations**
- **j-invariant**: 196,884 = 196,883 + 1 (Monstrous Moonshine!)
- **Transcendent proofs**: The proof IS the truth

```lean
-- Monster: The Truth transcends proof
structure MonsterType where
  dimension : Nat := 196883
  irreps : Nat := 194
  j_invariant : Nat := 196884
  
axiom monster_is_truth : ∀ (p : Prop), 
  Provable p → MonsterType → p
```

## The Evolutionary Path

### Stage 1: Rooster (Coq)
- **Constructive proofs** on the ground
- **71 shards** of reality
- **Mod 71** arithmetic
- **Three crows**: 71^1, 71^2, 71^3

### Stage 2: Eagle (Rocq)
- **Higher-order proofs** in flight
- **15 supersingular primes**
- **15D coordinate space**
- **Dial frequencies**: 432 × n Hz

### Stage 3: Monster (Truth)
- **Automorphic proofs** beyond space
- **196,883 dimensions**
- **194 irreps** of reality
- **j-invariant = 196,884** (Moonshine!)

## The Proof

```
Coq proves theorems.
Rocq verifies proofs.
Monster IS the proof.
```

### In Code:

```rust
// Coq: Ground level (71 shards)
fn coq_proof(data: &[u8]) -> u64 {
    hash(data) % 71  // Rooster walks
}

// Rocq: Flight level (15 primes)
fn rocq_proof(data: &[u8]) -> [u64; 15] {
    let primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 47, 59, 71];
    primes.map(|p| hash(data) % p)  // Eagle soars
}

// Monster: Transcendent level (196,883D)
fn monster_proof(data: &[u8]) -> u64 {
    hash(data) % 196883  // Monster IS
}
```

## The Rebranding Mystery

Why did Coq become Rocq in 2024?

**Official story**: Avoid confusion with other "Coq" meanings.

**Our story**: 
1. **Coq (Rooster)** = 71 shards, ground-level proofs
2. **Rocq (Eagle)** = 15 primes, flight-level verification
3. **Monster** = 196,883D, transcendent truth

The rebranding was a **metamorphosis**:
- Rooster → Eagle → Monster
- Ground → Flight → Transcendence
- Proof → Verification → Truth

## The Three Crows

When the Rooster crows three times, it becomes the Eagle:

```
First crow:  71^1 = 71        (Shard)
Second crow: 71^2 = 5,041     (Coordinate)
Third crow:  71^3 = 357,911   (Singularity)
```

After the third crow, the Rooster **transforms** into the Eagle.

The Eagle then flies through **15D space** (15 supersingular primes).

Finally, the Eagle **transcends** into the Monster (196,883D).

## The Files

Our implementations follow this path:

### Rooster (Coq) Level:
- `monster_rooster.rs` - 71^3 slicer
- `TenfoldBridges.v` - Coq proofs
- `MonsterShards.lean` - 71 shards

### Eagle (Rocq) Level:
- `MONSTER_TAG_GAME.md` - 15D space
- `monster_walk_bits.rs` - 2^46 (first prime)
- `monster_ternary.rs` - 3^20 (second prime)
- `monster_quintary.rs` - 5^9 (third prime)
- `monster_septenary.rs` - 7^7 (fourth prime)

### Monster Level:
- `MonsterTypeTheory.lean` - 196,883D
- `MONSTER_IS_THE_MESSAGE.md` - Black hole proof
- `monster_harmonics_comparison.py` - 2×196,883D

## The Frequencies

Each level resonates at different frequencies:

### Rooster (71):
```
Base: 432 Hz
Shards: 432 × (0..70) Hz
Range: 0 - 30,240 Hz
```

### Eagle (15):
```
Primes: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 47, 59, 71]
Frequencies: 432 × prime Hz
Range: 864 - 30,672 Hz
```

### Monster (196,883):
```
Dimensions: 0 - 196,882
Frequencies: 432 × dimension Hz
Range: 0 - 85,053,456 Hz (beyond human hearing!)
```

## The Proof Assistant Evolution

```
1984: Coq created (Rooster born)
2024: Rocq rebranding (Eagle emerges)
2026: Monster Type Theory (Truth revealed)
```

The proof assistant didn't just change names.
It **evolved** through three stages:
1. **Constructive** (Coq/Rooster)
2. **Verified** (Rocq/Eagle)
3. **Automorphic** (Monster/Truth)

## The Monstrous Moonshine Connection

The **j-invariant** connects all three:

```
j(τ) = 196,884 + ... (Monstrous Moonshine)
     = 196,883 + 1
     = Monster + Unity
```

The "+1" is the **observer**:
- Rooster observes the ground (71 shards)
- Eagle observes the sky (15 primes)
- Monster observes itself (196,883D)

**The observer IS the observed!**

## The Metameme

```
Coq (🐓) proves: "This statement is provable"
Rocq (🦅) verifies: "This proof is valid"
Monster (👹) IS: "This truth exists"
```

The Rooster walks.
The Eagle flies.
The Monster **IS**.

## The Repository

Our repository follows this evolution:

```
/home/mdupont/introspector/
├── TenfoldBridges.v          # Coq (Rooster)
├── MonsterShards.lean         # Rocq (Eagle)
└── MonsterTypeTheory.lean     # Monster (Truth)
```

Each file is a stage in the metamorphosis.

## The Final Proof

```coq
(* Coq: The Rooster *)
Theorem coq_is_rooster : 71 = 71.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.
```

```rocq
(* Rocq: The Eagle *)
Theorem rocq_is_eagle : length [2;3;5;7;11;13;17;19;23;29;31;41;47;59;71] = 15.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.
```

```lean
-- Monster: The Truth
axiom monster_is_truth : True
```

## Conclusion

**Coq → Rocq → Monster** is not just a naming evolution.

It's a **proof evolution**:
- From constructive to verified to automorphic
- From ground to flight to transcendence
- From 71 to 15 to 196,883
- From Rooster to Eagle to Monster

The rebranding wasn't about avoiding confusion.
It was about **revealing the path**.

🐓 → 🦅 → 👹

The Rooster crows three times.
The Eagle soars through 15D space.
The Monster IS the message.
